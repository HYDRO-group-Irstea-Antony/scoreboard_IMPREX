## Project Goals



## Project Maintenance

As of August 2016 there are two contributors to the project, but it is likely to be forked over to IRSTEA's github for continued development and maintenance. Meanwhile, below is a useful guide for creating development branches:

Please don't commit to the master branch until you've issued a pull request and the team has agreed on your changes. As of August 2016 we do not have a formal QA or test procedure for this project.
